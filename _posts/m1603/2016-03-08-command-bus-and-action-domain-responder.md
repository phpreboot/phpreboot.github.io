In his recent blog post, Paul M Jones is describing about `Command Bus pattern` and `Action-Domain-Responder pattern`. In this post, he is describing how they fit with each other and suggesting Command bus should be part of domain.

> Over the past few weeks, different people have asked me where a Command Bus goes in an Action-Domain-Responder system. While I’m not a DDD expert, after brushing up on the subject a little, my answer is: “In the Domain.”
