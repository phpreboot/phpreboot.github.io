On tutsplus, Bilal Shahid started a new series `Introducing wordpress REST API'. In the first post of the series, he is giving an introduction of REST API in wordpress.

> With its inception in 2003, WordPress has grown up from merely a blogging platform to a full fledged content management system. Over these past years, it has matured enough to cater the need of vast majority of online audience and this is the reason it’s empowering more than 20% of the web today.

> With many new features being added to WordPress, one of the latest to-be addition is the REST API that allows other apps and platforms to interact with WordPress. It’s a revolutionary addition that will help developers build custom applications and integrated systems with WordPress. Since it provides the capability to add and retrieve content from any other client or site, without the need of having WordPress installed on that site, it allows WordPress to be used with any programming language or platform.
