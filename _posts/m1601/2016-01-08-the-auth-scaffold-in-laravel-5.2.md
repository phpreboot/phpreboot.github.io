On his blog, Matt Stauffer posted next article `The auth scaffold in Laravel 5.2` of his series `New features in Laravel 5.2`.

In the current article, he describe how to use laravel scaffold to create basic authentication system.

> If you're like me, many of the applications you build in Laravel have a similar Saas-type framework: user signup, user login, password reset, public sales page, logged-in dashboard, logout route, and a base Bootstrap style for when you're just getting started.

> Laravel used to have a scaffold for this out of the box. It disappeared recently, to my great chagrin, but it's now back as an Artisan command: make:auth.
