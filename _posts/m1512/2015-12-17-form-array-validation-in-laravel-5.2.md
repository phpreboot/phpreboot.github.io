On his personal blog, Matt Stauffer started a new series on `New features in Laravel 5.2`. In the first article of the series, he is talking about `Form array validation`.

> Form array validation simplifies the process of validating the somewhat abnormal shape of data HTML forms pass in when the array syntax is used. If you're not familiar with it, a common use case is when you allow a user to add multiple instances of the same type on one form.
>
> Let's imagine you have a form where a user is adding a company, and as a part of it they can add as many employees to the company as they want. Each employee has a name and a title.
