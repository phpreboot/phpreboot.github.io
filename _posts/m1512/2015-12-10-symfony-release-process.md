On Symfony blog, Javier posted a new blog post describing new Symfony Release Process.

> The Symfony Release Process is arguably one of the best selling points of the Symfony project. Thanks to our predictable and transparent process, companies can plan years in ahead their Symfony integration.
> 
> These are the main changes introduced starting from 3.0 version:
> - Each major version (3.x, 4.x) will publish five minor versions (X.0, X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4).
> - All minor versions are standard versions (8 months of support) except the last one (X.4) which is a long term support version (36 months of support).
> - Major versions are released at the same time of the last minor version of the previous branch (e.g. 4.0.0 and 3.4.0 are released simultaneously).
