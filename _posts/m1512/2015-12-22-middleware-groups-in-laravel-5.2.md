On his personal blog, Matt Stauffer started a new series on `New features in Laravel 5.2`. In the last article of the series, he is talking about `Middleware groups in Laravel 5.2`.

> When you are creating a site of any significant size in Laravel, your routes file will often get pretty large. One of the first things I do in a new site is group my routes by logically distinct sections like "admin", "auth", "public". Usually each of these groups get their own set of middlewareâ€”admin, for example, gets auth. Maybe the API group gets a different auth middleware, and it might get an API-specific rate limiter or something else.

> Laravel 5.2 has introduced something called middleware groups, which are essentially a shortcut to applying a larger group of middleware, using a single key.
