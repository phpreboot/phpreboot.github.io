On Zend Devzone, Cal Evans presented his view on security if PHP application. He actually presenting counter view on one unknown post claiming 'Scripting languages like PHP are less secure'.

He put some good points that any PHP developer must know.

> “PHP IS INSECURE!”. Yet another consultant group has decided that their traffic stats are too low so they need to “shake things up a bit”. As usual, they picked PHP as the whipping boy. No, I am not going to link to them; too many people are already doing that unironically.

> While they do quote statistics to prove their point, they manage to leave out all details about how they gathered their statistics. Was the code they analyzed old PHP3 code? PHP4 code? Was there a predominant framework? We aren’t given that level of detail because it would allow us to possibly draw conclusions other than the ones they want us to draw.
