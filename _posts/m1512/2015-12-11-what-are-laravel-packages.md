On tutsplus, Alireza posted a nice article describing about laravel packages and how to create your own package.

> As a PHP developer, you may be interested in working with frameworks. Frameworks attempt to make the process of development easier by simplifying common practices used in the majority of developing web projects such as packages, modules, plug-ins, and even components (CakePHP).
>
> Perhaps during the development process, you feel you are reinventing the wheel, such as when creating an Authentication or Captcha application. In this case, you need to create a package which will simplify and make your app development faster and easier.
> 
> There are two types of packages; some are framework independent (stand-alone) and the others are for a specific framework. This tutorial will exclusively cover Laravel packages.
