On Sitepoint, Danial Sipos posted a tutorial on how to do `Easier Authentication with Guard in Symfony 3`.

> The Symfony2 security system is a complex part of the framework, one that is difficult to understand and work with for many people. It is very powerful and flexible, however not the most straightforward. For an example of custom authentication, check out my previous article that integrates Symfony with the UserApp service.

> With the release of version 2.8 (and the much awaited version 3), a new component was accepted into the Symfony framework: Guard. The purpose of this component is to integrate with the security system and provide a very easy way for creating custom authentications. It exposes a single interface, whose methods take you from the beginning to the end of the authentication chain: logical and all grouped together.
