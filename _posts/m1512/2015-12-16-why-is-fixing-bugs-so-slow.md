On his blog, Jani Hartikainen posted his view on `Why fixing bugs is os slow and how to make it faster`.

> Have you ever wondered why sometimes fixing bugs seems to take much longer than it should? When you finally find the problem, it turns out all you need is one small change. Yet, it took a lot of time to find what’s going on. This happens to me more often than I’d like.
>
> On the other hand, when you’re writing code and you go and test it and it doesn’t work correctly, fixing the bug is really quick. You jump back into your editor, whip up a line of code and the problem is solved.
>
> Why is it that sometimes fixing bugs takes a lot of work even when the problem is simple, and other times, it’s really quick to fix the problem – maybe even when it isn’t so trivial? Is there something we can learn from the bugs that are easy to fix, so that we could spend less time fixing bugs in general?

> Let’s talk about that, and see what ways there are that we can use to solve this problem and stop pulling our hair out because of hard to find bugs.
