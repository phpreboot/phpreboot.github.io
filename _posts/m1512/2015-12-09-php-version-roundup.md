Jack Skinner, on his blog, posted 'PHP Version roundup' for 2015. He collected versions of PHP installed of top 10 milloin websites. Some interesting figures to read on. As summary, PHP 5.3 is still most widely used PHP verison with approx 12% of servers using it. Its less then last year but considering PHP 5.3 is dead, it is still too high. Read on to read full statictics.

> Last year, Anthony Ferrara posted an excellent round up of PHP versions in the wild, specifically focusing on the volume of un-patched versions running production websites. Even as an estimate it was an eyeopening moment for many people.
> 
> 12 months on I've reproduced this report focusing on:
>
> - patch version fragmentation
> - % change in install numbers
> - % of installations running an insecure or out of date PHP version.
