On his blog, Leonid Mamchenkov posted about 'A PHP Error Output Bug' that he recently encountered.

He later found that PHP 'missing file' error is not showing correctly for his error_log and disply_errors settings.

> We came across this PHP bug at work today.  But before you go and read it, let me show you a use case.  See, if you can spot the problem.

> After a rather lengthy troubleshooting session we noticed that the updateProducts.php file was in fact named udpateProducts.php.  A simple typo in the file name.  But shouldnâ€™t that be printed out into the error output?
