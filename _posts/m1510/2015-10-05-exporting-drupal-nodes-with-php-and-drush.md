On PHP Architect, Oscar Merida posted an article on how to export drupal nodes using PHP and drush.

> With Drupal, it’s possible to build very intricate solutions by gluing the right combination of contrib modules together. Of course, there is a downside to relying only on contrib modules, particularly for one-off or highly custom tasks. Bringing in a contrib module means you assume responsibility for feeding and caring for it. If it’s a mature module, like Views, that’s one thing. But if you find yourself looking at a little-used module that hasn’t seen a stable release yet—or worse hasn’t been updated in months—you may be better off rolling your own solution.

> Drupal 8 development has shown that PHP itself, and the wider PHP community, already provides ways to solve common tasks. In this post, I’ll show you some core PHP functionality that you may not be aware of; pulling in packages and libraries via Composer is a topic for another day.
