On sitepoint, Daniel Sipos posted a tutorial on how to custom display suite fields in Drupal 8

> Without question, Display Suite is one of the most popular modules in Drupalâ€™s contributed modules history. It allows the creation of layouts, fields and exposes all sorts of other powerful tools we use to build the presentation layer of our Drupal sites.
>
> One of the more powerful features of Display Suite (DS) is the ability to create custom fields that can be displayed inside DS layouts alongside the actual core field values. In Drupal 7, this has been a very popular way of building layouts and showing dynamic data that is not strictly related to the output of any Field API field on the node (or other) entity.
