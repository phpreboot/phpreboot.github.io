On SitePoint, Nicola Pietroluongo posted a tutorial about Puli and how it cna re-revolutionize PHP Package development. Puli is a universal package system for PHP. Puli aims to replace “bundles”, “plugins”, “modules” and similar specialized packages of different frameworks with one generic, framework independent solution.

> Puli is a new toolkit built on top of Composer that helps to manage and exchange resources like configuration files, images, CSS files, translation catalogs, and others. These are, you’ll agree, often difficult to maintain and share across projects.
> 
> Puli provides a framework-agnostic solution to this problem, keeping track of every resource location and avoiding the problems of using absolute or relative paths inside different systems.
