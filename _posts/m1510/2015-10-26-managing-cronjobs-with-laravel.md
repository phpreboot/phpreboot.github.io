On Sitepoint, Reza Lavaryan posted a tutorial explaining how to schedule cronjobs with Laravel's commands

> There are times when your application needs to run administrative tasks periodically on the server. Whether you want to send out emails to your users or clean up the database tables at the end of the day, you will need a task scheduling mechanism to take care of the tasks, when it’s time.
> 
> Cron is a task scheduler in unix-like systems, which runs shell commands at certain intervals. This article is not meant for introducing Cron, but since it is a key concept in our tutorial, we’ll will describe the basics of how it works.
